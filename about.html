        <h2>The short version</h2>
        <p>
          On the <strong>first Friday</strong> of each month,
          you pledge to give <strong>50 <a href="#intl">dollars</a></strong> to support
          a <strong>free software package or application</strong> of your choice.
        </p>

        <h2>Why pledge?</h2>
        <p>
          Free software is
          <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=65230">at the heart</a>
          of all modern technology, but its maintainers—working-class developers and hobbyists 
          <a href="https://gayanvoice.github.io/top-github-users/index.html">around the world</a>—are
          <a href="https://thenewstack.io/open-source-needs-maintainers-but-how-can-they-get-paid/">rarely paid</a>
          and <a href="https://opensourcesurvey.org/">receive little appreciation</a> for their work.
        </p>
        <p>
          This
          <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/12/25/is-software-getting-worse/">isn't getting better</a>
          on its own. Most open-source projects
          <a href="https://www.itbrew.com/stories/2023/11/01/just-11-of-open-source-packages-are-still-being-maintained-report">
            are no longer maintained</a>.
          Several of the surviving ones have been commercialized, and
          over time, they're becoming expensive and difficult to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of us depend on free software for work, entertainment, and productivity at home.
          But we have no say in its future because <strong>we didn't participate</strong>.
          If we don't pay for it, a corporation will—or worse, they won't. Either way, we lose.
        </p>
        <p>
          50 for FOSS is a monthly community event in service of changing the status quo. 
          We believe it's time to <strong>insist on paying</strong> for the software we use. It's the only way
          to keep it alive.
        </p>

        <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
        <p>
          Most participants are <strong>tech workers or enthusiasts</strong>,
          but everyone is welcome to participate.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular, if you:
          <ul>
            <li>Work with computers</li>
            <li>Make enough money to comfortably pay all your bills</li>
            <li>Regularly use free and open-source software (FOSS)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          We invite you to take the pledge. You can help the software you use
          stay free, independent, and sustainable.
        </p>

        <h2>How do I participate?</h2>
        <p>
          On the first Friday of the month:
          <ul>
            <li>Pick any free software package or application.</li>
            <li>Give $50 to the maintainer(s), no strings attached.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Share your donation on social media with the hashtag #50forFOSS.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          There's no middleman here, no nonprofit, no gatekeeper or committee.
          It's just you, your wallet, and a maintainer who's about to have a
          very good day.

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <h3>How do you give $50 to a stranger?</h3>
        <p>
          Start by finding their website or code repository.
          Look for a <strong>Sponsorship</strong> section or a link to <strong>Ko-fi</strong>,
          <strong>Patreon</strong>, <strong>Buy Me a Coffee</strong>, <strong>PayPal</strong>,
          or <strong>Open Collective</strong>. If all else fails, open an issue or 
          send an email and <strong>ask the maintainer</strong> how to pay them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If they have any questions, send them to <a href="https://50forfoss.org">50forFOSS.org</a>.
        </p>
        <h3 id="intl">What if I'm not from the United States?</h3>
        <p>
          Give an equivalent amount in your local currency.
        </p>
        <h3>What if $50 is a lot of money to me?</h3>
        <p>
          Give less. $50 was chosen as a <strong>small, yet significant</strong> amount for the
          average tech worker, but if you would have to budget for it, there's no shame in adjusting
          the numbers. It still counts.
        </p>
        <h3>Aren't there better causes to support?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn't a zero-sum game. You can support the software you care about
          <strong>and</strong> give to the local food bank. Good causes are not in competition;
          <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268122004012">
            giving leads to giving</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Don't software developers make enough money?</h3>
        <p>
          Some software developers are wealthy. Most are not. Free software is made by
          a diverse group of people from different countries, economic backgrounds,
          and professions. The maintainer of an app you use daily could be a staff engineer in San Francisco,
          a college student in Ghana, or a taxi driver in Ukraine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless, supporting a free software project isn't just about the maintainer's material needs
          (although those are important). It's also about our rights as users: the right to have a stake 
          in the things we use, to pay and not be paid for, to be
          <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/07/16/product/">a customer and not a product</a>.
          We pay so our software can answer to us, not the first advertiser or investment bank
          to come calling. We pay so our apps won't become abandonware and have to be replaced
          in three years.
        </p>
        <h3>What's the exact definition of "FOSS"?</h3>
        <p>
          We're not here to split hairs. Any piece of <strong>non-commercialized software</strong> is eligible,
          whether it's a tiny Python script that saved you two hours on a home automation project
          or a massive C# package your team uses every day at work. There's plenty of
          appreciation to go around.
        </p>
        <h3>How can I find projects to give to?</h3>
        <p>
          Free software is everywhere you look:
          <ul>
            <li>Applications on your computer.</li>
            <li>Plugins and extensions in your web browser.</li>
            <li>Mods for your video games.</li>
            <li>Add-ons for your productivity and notetaking tools.</li>
            <li>Apps on your smartphone.</li>
            <li>Web services on your home server or NAS.</li>
            <li>Dependency files in your code repositories.</li>
            <li>The Linux distribution you use.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you use NPM modules at work, you can run
          <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-fund">npm fund</a>
          to find maintainers looking for donations.
        </p>
        <h3>Are there other ways to give?</h3>
        <p>
          If hand-picking a project every month isn't for you, consider participating in another way:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use <a href="https://www.thanks.dev">thanks.dev</a> to automatically fund 
              the libraries in your dependency tree.
            </li>
            <li>
              Talk to your employer about signing the <a href="https://osspledge.com/">Open Source Pledge</a>
              or subscribing to <a href="https://tidelift.com/">Tidelift</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set up a recurring donation to the
              <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation,</a> the
              <a href="https://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>,
              <a href="https://www.spi-inc.org/">Software in the Public Interest</a>,
              <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>,
              or <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/organizations">any other nonprofit software foundation</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
